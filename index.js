  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

  TASK 2

    - All instances built with Car:
        + should initialize with an `tank` at 0
        + should initialize with an `odometer` at 0

        + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
        + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
        + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. Window/Global Object Binding - Global "this" === window/console Object (behind the scenes)
  2. Implicit Binding - When a function is called with a method, the object to the left of the dot is "this".
  3. New Binding - In terms of key:value pairs, When using "this" in a constructor function it refers to the key.
  4. Explicit Binding - when using .call, "this" defines new instances for the subclass.
